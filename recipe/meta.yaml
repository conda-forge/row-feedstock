  description: |
    Row is a command line tool that helps you manage workflows on HPC resources. Define
    **actions** in a workflow configuration file that apply to **groups** of **directories**
    in your **workspace**. **Submit** actions to your cluster's **scheduler**. Row tracks
    which actions have been submitted on which directories so that you don't submit the same
    work twice. Once a job completes, subsequent actions become eligible allowing you to
    process your entire workflow to completion over many submissions.
